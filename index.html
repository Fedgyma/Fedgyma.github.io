    Linux is better than Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS for many reasons.<br>
    Including privacy, stability and customization. Linux is more open,<br>
    and it is becoming mainstream for developers all around.<br>
    Linux is more stable than Windows or macOS, which are both proprietary,<br>
    and can easily implement software to break the users privacy.<br>
    Linux is everywhere, inside embedded systems and many IoT devices.<br>
    Linux is everywhere, and gaming is becoming even more of an option on Linux,<br>
    which is made possible with tools like Wine, Lutris and Pronton,<br>
    many with even better performance on Linux than on Windows.<br>
    Linux is just better.
